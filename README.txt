Spider analysis:
Given that lambda2 is 0, the LGP is virtually the same as the Poisson distribution meaning that the spider distribution is random.

Sowbug analysis:
By visual inspection, LGP with λ1=1.541637, λ2=0.53214 fit the sowbug data better than the naive Poisson distribution.

Weevil egg analysis:
There is no bean with two eggs, beans have either zero or only one egg, suggesting that there might be a repulsive factor at play 
With a dLGP model fit unto the experimental data, the lambda2 parameter that fits the data well is -0.24, supporting the hypothesis that weevil might be overdispersing their eggs
